##Â Bookmark Manager

Task:
-----

We are going to write a bookmark manager application that allows users to save urls of websites that they want to store, so that they can look at them and use them when required. The aim of this weekly challenge was to gain a greater knowledge of databases and how they fit into the request/response cycle of a web application. This was done using Ruby for the model, Sinatra for the application framework, capybara/RSPec for the testing, and PostgreSQL for the database management.

Approach:
---------

The approach was to establish an initial database that would store a bookmark, which would have id, title, and a url columns. These columns would form the basis for the Bookmark class logic.

The aim was to be able to set up an ORM, which would allow the sinatra application to talk to the database, and update it with data supplied by the client. Although this challenge was not 100% completed, it provided a firm foundation for my knowledge of database - application relationships, knowledge that was solidified with the Chitter weekend challenge.
